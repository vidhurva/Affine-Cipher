# Affine-Cipher
Neat Code in Programming Affine Cipher

Hello readers! In this program, I developed a Affine Cipher, which is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. This program  allows users to enter a message, a alpha variable, and a beta variable. The purpose of this program is to code an algorithm that allows one to encrypt and decrypt an entered string.

The resulted output is the user's original message, encrypted message, and the decrypted message (the original string inputted in the program).
